You're given a substring s of some cyclic string. What's the length of the smallest possible string that can be concatenated to itself many times to obtain this cyclic string?

Example

For s = "cabca", the output should be
cyclicString(s) = 3.

"cabca" is a substring of a cycle string "abcabcabcabc..." that can be obtained by concatenating "abc" to itself. Thus, the answer is 3.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] string s

Guaranteed constraints:
3 ≤ s.length ≤ 15.

[output] integer

[Python3] Syntax Tips

# Prints help message to the console
# Returns a string
def helloWorld(name):
    print("This prints to the console when you Run Tests")
    return "Hello, " + name
